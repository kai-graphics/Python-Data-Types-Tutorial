print("""
 int       - Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3)
 float     - Decimal numbers (e.g., 2.71)
 str       - Text data (e.g., "Python")
 bool      - True or False
 list      - Mutable list of items
 tuple     - Immutable sequence
 set       - Unique unordered values
 dict      - Key-value mappings
 NoneType  - Means 'nothing here'
